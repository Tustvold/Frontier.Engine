Frontier.Engine
===============

## Description

A wrapper around OpenGL which provides some basic functionality (Shaders, VAO Management, Truetype Font Rendering, etc).
It was created as part of a voxel engine and so is designed to be as lightweight as possible both in terms of CPU and memory usage.

## Installation

Coming Soon

## Still to do

- Better 2D support (currently all vertices are 3D)
- Proper AppDelegate system with support for handling the window losing focus, etc
- System to verify that the mesh being used and the shader are compatible
- Skeletal Animation
- Obj import
- Mouse input
- Multithreading support (ThreadPools etc)
- Lighting

These features, among others, will be added as I need them in my other projects but feel free to contribute your own implementations.
